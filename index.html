            <h1>books</h3>
            <p>I absolutely love reading books. Reading books is my favourite thing to do apart from sleeping jk ;). Yeah but honestly ever want to give me a gift then just give me a nice classic book, I'll appreciate if it will have a author's note too :). So this contains list of some of my fav books over the years. Have a look and suggest me some good ones if you know. My fav genres are <strong>thriller, mystery, drama, historical fiction, war and magic.</strong>If you know a book that is great but doesn't fall in these genres then also recommend it :).</p>
